# Marvel
Hello  this is the result of the test.

I have an isse that I couldn't solve and it is that Picasso and Glide doesn't load the Image url to the ImageView, I could load other image from an firebase url that I uploaded 
This is the url https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fir-ecb2b.appspot.com/o/uploads%2F1583631375309.jpg?alt=media&token=05680ca0-1447-4751-8c27-15d5e0a162ef

I got next links from Marvel but I couldn't load them into the ImageView.

So, now is hardcoded the image link  and the placeholderis is the logo that i create
